# javascript
Learning javascript a step at a time <br>

An extense repository displaying diverse javascript activities that vary from beginner classes to more advanced classes involving Dom and Events. <br> 
Mini-Projects based on Colt Steele's Web Developer 2021 Course on Udemy and additional projects from other JS teachers.<br>

There are not that many comments or hints, since these are my student notes and more an archive of solutions and ideas accumulated into one large repository as to avoid a cluster. <br>

Note that some files may not run in server, this is due to the necessity to reorganize the files. Consequentely, some index.html files are not connected with their sister app.js. Correcting that, they should function normally. <br>

if you have any doubts or questions, I am free to answer.
