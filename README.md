# javascript
Learning javascript a step at a time <br>

An extense repository displaying diverse javascript activities that vary from beginner classes to more advanced classes involving Dom and Events. <br> 
Mini-Projects based on Colt Steele's Web Developer 2021 Course on Udemy and additional projects from other JS teachers.<br>

There are not that many comments or hints, since these are my student notes and more an archive of solutions and ideas accumulated into one large repository as to avoid a cluster. <br>

if you have any doubts or questions, I am free to answer.
