JavaScript is:

High Level - automatizes recourses, faster process. (i.e. C vs JS)
Multi-Paradigm - JS runs as a Linear language, an OOP language or as a Functional language.

Call-Stack / Single-threading = {
    Variables declared outside a function become global
    Declared Functions create a execution context = {
        What must be done to execute the function (ie. X + Y = Z)
    }

    Globals always initiate the callstack, falling at the bottom of it.
    
    Above them are the functions, which will be executed
     so that the call stack can return to the first-piece of the stack (global variable)
}
